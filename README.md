## Features

In Battleship, you can:

- **Strategically Place Ships**: Easily place your ships in any direction by clicking on the board.

- **Compete against AI**: The Artificial Intelligence uses a combination of random and strategic attacks.

- **Check ship status**: The Ship Counter is easy to see and intuitive.

- **Train your Brain**: Calculate the most optimal attacks and learn to strategize.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

In short, Battleship was created using "Test Driven Development" which means that I created tests for classes and functions before I wrote them. I began the project by creating tests for the classes and methods for Ships, Players, and Gameboards. Then, I implemented the UI, the most difficult part, which came with a lot of problems. I 'connected' the HTML and the JavaScript using event listeners and DOM manipulation. Finally, I revamped the AI and increased it's attacking intelligence.

# Improvements:

Battleship could be improved by implementing a probability density map. It would allow the AI to attack squares with the highest probability of having a ship and make it much harder for the user to win.

# Lessons Learned:

I learned a lot about Test Driven Development, unit testing, and mocking. I also learned about extremely (too extreme FOR NOW) advanced ways of making the most optimal Battleship AI's that would be impossible for a human to beat.
